Welcome to Putnal Breakout™!

This game is easy to run; once you open the game, all you need to do is press start to start the fun!

Once you press start, the green ball will start moving. You control the blue paddle at the bottom; your objective is to bounce the ball into 
the red bars at the top of the screen. You do this by moving the paddle left and right to catch the ball as it approaches the bottom of the screen.

Be careful! If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, it's Game Over! You'll have to start again with all of the original bars.

When all of the red bars are gone, you win! You can then start the game again to relive the action.

Remember; at any time you can press the start button to pause the fun! Pressing start again will resume your current game.
